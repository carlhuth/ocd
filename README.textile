*ocd* - ocd C decompiler

*Quick introduction*
ocd is a C decompiler written in Python, currently supporting decompilation of programs compiled for the x64 architecture.

The decompiler performs some inferences as to the program structure (such as control and data flow analysis).

The internal data structures used for instructions are quite universal, so it should be trivial to add additional architectures as they are needed, as well as new output languages.

*Quick start*
Running *./ocd.py PROGRAM*, e.g. *./ocd.py /usr/bin/yes* will decompile *PROGRAM*. 

There are some tests in /tests, just do *cd tests; make*, then for example run *./ocd.py tests/test_ack*

Run *./ocd.py --help* to get more options.
